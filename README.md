# releaf_coding_challenge

The coding challenge in itself consists of scraping google search results for relevant links related to the companies
listed in Scrape_Assignment_DataSet.csv

Having never created a webscraper before, I turned to our good old friend Google and his little cousin Youtube to see
if you could find anything of use. I chose Python because I do not have much experience as a software engineer, and the 
language is very english like. That aspect usually makes things easier for me. 

My source code is based off this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EELySnTPeyw">tutorial</a> on Youtube.
