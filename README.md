The coding challenge in itself consists of scraping google search results for relevant links related to the companies
listed in Scrape_Assignment_DataSet.csv.

Having never created a webscraper before, I turned to our good old friend Google and his little cousin Youtube to see
if I could find anything of use. I chose Python because I do not have much experience as a software engineer, and the 
language is very english like. That aspect usually makes things easier for me. 

My source code is based off this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EELySnTPeyw">tutorial</a> on Youtube. 

Listed below are current roadbloacks I'm facing, and also some on the next steps I plan on taking.

Roadbloack(s):

1. Script is succesfully running from the command line, but there is no output.

To Do List:

1. Figure out why the script is not producing any output

2. Use information from TDL1 to fix R1.

3. Pour output of links in Scrape_Assignment_Dataset.csv.

4. Update source code to prompt user to enter the name of the company they would like to get relevant links about.
